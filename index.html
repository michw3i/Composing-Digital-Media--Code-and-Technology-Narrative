Once you understand your reference position, you can begin glitching with more precision.   
   
To add your glitch image, simply find and delete the hero.jpg file in the project folder. Then name your glitched image file to the project folder and name it "hero.jpg."

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>I'm a sophomore majoring in Computer Science, and I'm from outside of Philly (in the King of Prussia area). One of my earliest experiences with digital technology was playing Roblox as a child. I spent hours exploring games and customizing my avatar, but I was always curious about how the games worked and how people built these games in the first place. I was first introduced to Python in high school, and I actually found it interesting, which helped me realize that coding was something I could enjoy learning. When I started coding
      later on in school, it felt very different at first. Writing code was confusing and frustrating, and I didn't get it right away. But every time something finally worked, it reminded me of that same curiosity I had back then on Roblox. That early experience made coding feel less intimidating and more like something I could grow into, and it played a big role in why I decided to major in Computer Science. </p>

<!--Flexbox uses rows and column classes to create layouts that scale content across devices. The style.css page provides other attributes that will adjust the image depending on the size of screens. Add images to your project folder and make sure the file name/type matches in your code. Resize images to less than 600px in width. This will improve load time accessibility. Don't forget to add alt="text"-->

<!--Conduct your own Dear Data inquiry…collecting, analyzing, and communicating data (Shout out to Dear Data authors Georgia Lupi and Stefanie Posavec). Use your built-in screen time monitoring features on your phone, tablet, and computer to assist you in tracking your technology use over 5-7 days. Then create a data visualization using colored pencils, crayons, or markers that tells the story of you and your data. Here's our framing question “How do you interact with technology and in what ways? (frequency and distribution of various activities.) For example: What apps get you through your day, what kinds of media are you consuming, what kinds of websites are you using?-->

    <div class="text-block" style="text-align: left">
  <h2>Everyday Code</h2>
    <p>Code shapes how we think, act, and move through the world by influencing our habits and routines. Apps and platforms use algorithms to guide what we click, how long we stay, and how long we return. Completing the Dear Data visualization showed me I spend more time on my phone than I realized, especially of social apps, while my laptop is mostly for schoolwork. The data shows that I spend time on, Instagram, TikTok, and Messages on my phone, but Chrome, Terminal, and PowerPoint dominate my laptop. </p>

Understanding code helps us see how platforms shape our experiences, recognize algorithmic biases, and make informed choices online. </p>

    <p>I see code and technology opening doors to creative problem-solving and building tools that make life easier or more interesting.

I want to learn more about web development, user experience design, and how algorithms influence behavior online. I’m also curious about how to use code and digital tools to analyze real-world data and make informed decisions.</p>
